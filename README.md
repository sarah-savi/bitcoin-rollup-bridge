# Bitcoin Anchored Optimistic Rollup Smart Contract

## Overview

This Clarity smart contract implements a Bitcoin-anchored optimistic rollup system designed to enhance transaction efficiency and scalability on the Stacks blockchain. The contract provides a secure mechanism for managing off-chain transactions while maintaining on-chain security and integrity.

## Features

### Key Functionalities

- Operator Registration
- State Commitment Submission
- Commitment Challenging
- Deposits and Withdrawals
- Internal Rollup Transfers
- Challenge Resolution

### Security Mechanisms

- Input validation for all transactions
- Operator authentication
- Challenge period for state commitments
- Merkle proof validation
- Comprehensive error handling

## Contract Components

### Error Constants

- `ERR_INVALID_OPERATOR`: Invalid operator registration
- `ERR_INVALID_COMMITMENT`: Invalid state commitment
- `ERR_CHALLENGE_PERIOD`: Challenge period violation
- `ERR_INVALID_PROOF`: Invalid merkle proof
- `ERR_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`: Insufficient user balance
- `ERR_INVALID_INPUT`: Invalid transaction input
- `ERR_UNAUTHORIZED`: Unauthorized action

### Storage Maps

1. `operators`: Tracks registered and active operators
2. `state-commitments`: Stores blockchain state commitments
3. `user-balances`: Manages user token balances within the rollup
4. `challenges`: Records and tracks commitment challenges

## Public Functions

### 1. `register-operator()`

- Allows contract owner to register operators
- Prevents duplicate registrations
- Requires sender to be contract owner

### 2. `submit-state-commitment()`

- Operators submit state commitments
- Validates input parameters
- Requires minimum stake/bond
- Stores commitment details

### 3. `challenge-commitment()`

- Enables challenging of potentially invalid state commitments
- Requires challenge bond
- Records challenge details

### 4. `deposit()`

- Users deposit funds into the rollup
- Validates deposit amount and token identifier
- Transfers tokens to contract
- Updates user balance

### 5. `withdraw()`

- Users withdraw funds from the rollup
- Requires valid merkle proof
- Validates user balance
- Transfers funds back to user

### 6. `transfer-in-rollup()`

- Enables internal transfers between users
- Validates sender and recipient
- Updates balances accordingly

### 7. `resolve-challenge()`

- Resolves previously submitted challenges
- Validates challenge and commitment existence

## Read-Only Functions

### `get-user-balance()`

- Retrieves user balance for a specific token identifier

## Security Considerations

- Comprehensive input validation
- Operator authentication
- Challenge mechanism for state commitments
- Minimum stake requirements
- Merkle proof validation for withdrawals

## Deployment Requirements

- Requires Clarity VM (ClarityVM)
- Minimum Stacks blockchain version compatibility
- Recommended minimum stake for operators

## Potential Improvements

- Implement more complex merkle proof validation
- Add time-based challenge periods
- Enhance operator slashing mechanism
- Implement more granular access controls

## Usage Example

```clarity
;; Register an operator
(contract-call? .bitcoin-rollup-bridge register-operator)

;; Deposit funds
(contract-call? .bitcoin-rollup-bridge deposit u1000 u1)

;; Transfer within rollup
(contract-call? .bitcoin-rollup-bridge transfer-in-rollup
  tx-sender
  'ST1SJ3DTE5DN7X54YDH5D64R3BCB6A2AG2ZQ8YPD5
  u500
  u1
)
